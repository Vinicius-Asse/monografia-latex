In 2018, NVIDIA announced a new programable module for theirs GPUs capable of improve the current rendering flow. In order to explore its new features, we studied their use in the context of procedural geometry generation. For that, we developed a tool able to compile and execute mesh shaders. With that, we could observe the performance and resource usage during de marching cubes algorithm execution. Finally, we compare the results with the compute shader implementation.
